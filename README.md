# 2D Radon transform and 3D John transform matrices
The first Julia code constructs a 2D Radon transform matrix by a raycasting method, when a function is approximated with
linear triangular shape functions, i.e an unstructured mesh.  The function _test_ calculates a sinogram for Sheppâ€“Logan using the file  _phantom.mat_. 

On the other hand, the second code uses raycasting to construct a 3D John transform matrix in a structured mesh of voxels. The test function calculates projections for a simple ellipsoid.
